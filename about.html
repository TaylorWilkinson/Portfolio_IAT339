          <h2>"Hello, World!"</h2>
          <p>My name is Taylor and I'm an aspiring front-end web developer with an interest in user-experience design. I'm pursing my B.Sc. in Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University.</p>
          <p>My goal as a developer is to create applications that follow best practices and provide an enjoyable experience. As an articulate communicator, I easily engage with stakeholders to create a refined product. I'm your friendly, neighbourhood <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs INFP</a>, so you can count on me to stay calm and collected in any situation.</p>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy going for walks, Dungeons & Dragons, and playing video games.  Outside of work-related topics, you can talk with me about baking, the art of drag, and your pet dog (pictured right).</p>
