      <section id="bio">
        <p>My name is Taylor and I'm an aspiring developer with a strong interest in user-experience design and front-end web development. I'm pursing a B.Sc. in Interactive Arts and Technology with a concentration in Interactive Systems.</p>
        <p>My goal is to grow as a developer and designer by creating applications that provide experiences that are not only enjoyable for the user, but are considerate of a diverse userbase regardless of economic, or ethnic status. As an articulate communicator, I'm able to engage with coworkers and customers alike to achieve the most desired result. I'm your friendly, neighbourhood Myers-Briggs INFP.</p>
        <p>I enjoy going for walks around the Greater Vancouver area, hobbyist photography, and Dungeons & Dragons. I'm an avid lover of video games, including (but not limited to) Stardew Valley, Overwatch, Super Mario Odyssey, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Shadow of the Colossus. Outside of work-related topics, you can talk with me about baking, the art of drag, and my family's pet dog (pictured right).</p>
