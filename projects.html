          <h2>My Role:</h2>
          <p>Web Developer & Designer</p>

          <h2>Brief:</h2>
          <p>Develop a web application using a database of our own choosing that implements a set of required technologies.<br>
              This was a final course project for IAT 352 - Internet Computing Technologies. March 2017.</p>

          <h2>Process:</h2>
          <p>When I approached with this project, I came up with the idea for The Studious Chef: a website that would help students cook proper meals for themselves by providing a consolidated list of delicious recipes posted by students, for students. With this in mind, I wanted this website to look clean, simple and approachable to the user, so I restricted the colours being used to black and white with some powder blue accents.</p>
          <p>With this project, I had the opportunity to learn several new programming languages as well as gaining more experience with HTML and CSS. The webpages were coded in PHP, with embedded HTML and CSS in order to realize the design. AJAX was used in order to support live filtering and updating on the recipe browsing page. Finally, MySQL was used to handle database requests, such as logging in or fetching recipes from the "recipe" database.</p>
          <p>After determining the website concept, I realized the database design through ER diagrams. The database of recipes was built in XAMPP with 20 recipes to begin with, which allowed non-registered users to still browse content if there was no member-generated contents.</p>

          <h2>My Role:</h2>
          <p>Web Developer; User Experience Developer</p>
          <h2>Brief:</h2>
          <p>Design, code and present a responsive website about retrofitting your home, based on data provided by City Studio Vancouver.<br>
          This was a group course project for Information Design course (IAT 235). 2015.</p>

          <h2>Process:</h2>
          <p>Our team started by analyzing the provided data of 500 homes, determining 3 factors to consider when retrofitting one's home: cost, environmental, and lifestyle. With this information, we determined the information architecture of the website through basic wireframing. After determining our desired user flow, we moved on to create higher fidelity wireframes of our website using Axure RP. In this phase we continued refining our content, created more detailed blocked elements and played with different interaction elements that we could incorporate.</p>
          <p>Once we determined our website's architecture and overall design, all three team members wrote equal portions of the website's code. I personally wrote the environment page and it's two subsections. Additionally, I was responsible for consolidating all 11 pages and maintaining their responsive design. HTML5 and CSS were used to build the site.</p>
