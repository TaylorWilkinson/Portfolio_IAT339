        <h2>The Studious Chef</h2>
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>Web Developer & Designer</p>
        <h3>Brief:</h3>
        <p>Develop a web application using a database of our own choosing that implements a set of required technologies.<br>
          This was a final course project for IAT 352 - Internet Computing Technologies. March 2017.
        </p>
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>When I approached with this project, I came up with the idea for The Studious Chef: a website that would help students cook proper meals for themselves by providing a consolidated list of delicious recipes posted by students, for students. With this in mind, I wanted this website to look clean, simple and approachable to the user, so I restricted the colours being used to black and white with some powder blue accents.</p>
        <p>With this project, I had the opportunity to learn several new programming languages as well as gaining more experience with HTML and CSS. The webpages were coded in PHP, with embedded HTML and CSS in order to realize the design. AJAX was used in order to support live filtering and updating on the recipe browsing page. Finally, MySQL was used to handle database requests, such as logging in or fetching recipes from the "recipe" database.</p>
        <p>After determining the website concept, I realized the database design through ER diagrams. The database of recipes was built in XAMPP with 20 recipes to begin with, which allowed non-registered users to still browse content if there was no member-generated contents.</p>

          <h2>Adoption Awareness Month</h2>
          <h3>My Role:</h3>
          <p>Communications Co-ordinator, Primary Designer, Video Edito</p>
          <h3>Brief:</h3>
          <p>Proposed and executed a social media campaign for the Adoptive Families Association of BC (AFABC) in light of Adoption Awareness Month. November 2017.</p>
          <h3>Process:</h3>
          <p>The month leading up to Adoption Awareness Month, I learned about communications planning and developing messaging for digital content. With the Publications Coordinator and the Communications Manager, we determined the primary message and goals for AFABC’s Adoption Awareness Month campaign. At this stage, we determined roles, responsibilities, and projects for the month. I suggested creating a series of videos for AFABC’s social media, which became my personal project.</p>
          <p>The video campaign for Adoption Awareness Month was completely conceptualized and executed by myself, which made it my major contribution to the overall campaign. The goal of these short videos was to normalize adoption and celebrate adoptive families. I used pre-recorded footage of adoptees and adoptive parents from a recent open house hosted by AFABC, and re-created animated video bumpers that had been made for them several years prior.</p>
          <p>Setting a project timeline was exteremly important, as I needed to create these videos on my own while continuing to co-ordinate other events and handle my other daily tasks. After setting my timeline to ensure I'd meet my November 1st deadline, I selected videos and music that were similar in tone and message while supporting the “#FamilyEverybodyNeedsOne” tagline. Once deciding on the videos and messaging, I began creating both the video bumpers and finalized videos. I had no prior experience with Premiere Pro, which was what I had to work with, so I sought out online tutorials to teach myself the basics and learned on the job.</p>
          <p>Despite having planned to only create four videos, I was able to manage my time effectively and made six videos for the month: four that focused on young adoptees speaking about what the word “family” meant to them, and two that focused on giving advice for prospective adoptive parents and to kids going through the adoption process. They were well received on social media, getting the most engagement on Facebook as that’s where the majority of AFABC’s online followers are.</p>
